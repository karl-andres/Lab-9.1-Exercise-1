Step 1

9d73ed7 (HEAD -> main, origin/main) file two
099be13 file one

Step 2

* leading_edge
  main

3f5e2a0 (HEAD -> leading_edge, main) step 1
9d73ed7 (origin/main) file two
099be13 file one

Step 3

* leading_edge
  main

fc6f641 (HEAD -> leading_edge, origin/leading_edge) update file 2
fb6a9e7 file 3
bbcc7b4 step two
3f5e2a0 (main) step 1
9d73ed7 (origin/main) file two
099be13 file one

Step 4

Yes it would work, but for it to work we would to have resolve the merge conflict on file2.txt.
This is because I changed file2.txt on the leading_edge branch. On the original main branch it is not updated,
so when attempting to merge I would have to resolve this conflict.
